#Autoencoders
Autoencoders are a type of neural network used primarily for the task of data compression and reconstruction. They work by learning a compressed representation of the input data, which can be used to reconstruct the original input as closely as possible. An autoencoder consists of two main parts: the encoder, which compresses the input into a smaller encoding, and the decoder, which attempts to recreate the input from this encoding. Autoencoders are trained by minimizing the difference between the input and its reconstruction, typically using a loss function such as mean squared error. They are useful in applications like anomaly detection, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction, particularly in image processing and similar fields.
