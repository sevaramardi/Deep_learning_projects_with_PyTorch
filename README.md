#Autoencoders
In this repository Autoencoders were used for image reconstruction task. There are two projects: CNN and ANN based Autoencoders. 
  -CNN based Autoencoders:
     -In this projects were bult classic CNN model with 2 layers convolution encoder which compress the data and 2 layers convolution transpose decoders which attempt to reconstruct the image.         *Used dataset CIFAR10
       *Model was designed by using such as tools- Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Matplotlib.
       *As a test version model was trained for 5 epochs. Results are posted in the repository in Jupyter Nootebook.
       *Code for plotting also available.
  -ANN based Autoenders:
