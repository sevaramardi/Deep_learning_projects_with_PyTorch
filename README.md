#Autoencoders
In this repository Autoencoders were used for image reconstruction task. There are two projects: CNN and ANN based Autoencoders.  

  -CNN based Autoencoders:
  
     -In this projects are bult classic CNN model with 2 layers convolution encoder which compress the data and 2 layers convolution transpose decoders which attempt to reconstruct the image. 
      
       *Used dataset CIFAR10.
       *Model is designed by using such as tools- Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Matplotlib.
       *Mean Square Error loss 
       *ReLU activation function in hidden layers, in output Tanh activation function.
       *Results are posted in the repository in Jupyter Nootebook. 
       *Code for plotting also available.
       
  -ANN based Autoenders:

    -In this projects are bult classic ANN model with 4 layers linear encoder which compress the data and 2 layers linear decoders which attempt to reconstruct the image. The encoder part           decreases number of neurons and decoders recunstruct image by increasing the 

       *Used dataset MNIST (Handwritten).
       *Model is designed by using such as tools- Python, PyTorch, Jupyter Notebook, Numpy, Matplotlib.
       *Mean Square Error loss 
       *ReLU activation function in hidden layers, in output Sigmoid activation function.
       *Results are posted in the repository in Jupyter Nootebook. 
       *Code for plotting also available.
