Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images, designed as a more challenging replacement for the classic MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The dataset was created by researchers as a benchmark for machine learning models, to provide a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST that would require minimal changes in the code for switching between them. 
Content: The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images in 10 fashion categories, with each image being 28x28 pixels. This is similar to the original MNIST in terms of the size of the images and the structure of the dataset.
Code: In this code is implemneted image classification for fashion-mnist dataset. Here is created CNN based model with batchnormalization, average and max poolings. Model reaches 90% accuracy ,with 50 epochs. The number of epochs depend on the user.
